##To play game:

        - Download the files and Compile: javac StartGame.java
        - Run the program               : java StartGame

##How the game should work: 

        - The initial greeting window should be asking whether the user feels like playing.
        - If the user chooses not to play, it should display a goodbye message and close window after 2s.
        - If the user chooses to play, a new frame should show up with the letters of the word masked as "_" and providing options to get hint, to exit or to replay. 
        - If the user guesses the correct word, the frame should show a happy man waving.
        - If the user guesses the word incorrectly 10 times, the frame should show a drawing of a man hanging (hence the name Hangman)
